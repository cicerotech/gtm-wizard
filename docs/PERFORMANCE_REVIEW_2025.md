# Performance Review 2025 - Final Responses

---

## Question 1: What were your key accomplishments / what are you most proud of achieving over the past year?

When I joined as Chief of Staff, my role was to support the Head of GTM with operational coordination—running meetings, tracking action items, and managing communications. Over the course of 2025, I identified a structural gap in how Eudia captures and flows customer intelligence, and I took ownership of building the infrastructure to solve it.

This work expanded significantly beyond my original scope:

**Built and deployed GTM Brain** — a production intelligence platform connecting Slack, Obsidian, Outlook calendars, and Salesforce. This system is now live and used daily by the sales team, enabling natural language queries ("show pipeline for Cargill"), automated meeting prep, and real-time pipeline visibility.

**Developed Salesforce automation** — custom Apex classes and Flows that auto-create Delivery records at Stage 4 and sync contract data at Close Won. This removes the manual data entry burden from Business Leads post-deal, ensuring clean data flows to Finance (Campfire) and Delivery (Rocket Lane) without additional input.

**Implemented AI-powered capabilities** — meeting classification, note summarization, and contract extraction using Claude and OpenAI APIs. Business Leads can now transcribe meetings directly in Obsidian, with AI generating structured summaries, MEDDICC signals, and next steps that sync to Salesforce.

**Created BL performance infrastructure** — custom Salesforce objects tracking time-to-ramp, monthly productivity, and YTD/QTD ACV, with weekly automated reports to leadership. This provides visibility into rep performance that previously required manual spreadsheet work.

**Established clean data foundations** — standardized opportunity stages, product lines, and account structures to enable accurate downstream reporting and analytics. This was unglamorous but essential groundwork.

I'm most proud that this work aligns directly with the Revenue Operations Lead responsibilities Eudia posted 6 months ago—systems design, process automation, analytics infrastructure, and enabling field productivity. I identified where I could add the most value and executed with autonomy.

## Question 2: What could you have done differently to have achieved greater impact and outcomes in 2025?

I could have been more proactive in cross-functional partnership earlier in the year. While I prioritized building momentum on technical execution, I sometimes moved quickly on solutions before fully socializing approaches with stakeholders who would be affected.

In retrospect, earlier and more frequent collaboration with Sales leadership and Finance would have helped align priorities and surface edge cases sooner. The work got done well, but the path could have been smoother with more structured check-ins along the way.

Additionally, I could have documented systems and processes more thoroughly as I built them, rather than backfilling documentation later. As these tools become organizational infrastructure, ensuring they are maintainable and understandable beyond my direct involvement is important.

This is something I'm actively addressing—I've begun scheduling regular syncs with key stakeholders and have started building out documentation for the systems I've created.

## Question 3: Overall, how would you rate your performance over the past year?

**Exceeds Expectations**

---

## Question 4: Please share your rationale for the performance rating you selected

I rate myself "Exceeds Expectations" because I have been operating significantly beyond the scope of my Chief of Staff role.

**My original JD focused on:** supporting the Head of GTM, managing day-to-day operations (pipeline reviews, forecasts, QBRs), representing leadership in meetings, preparing communications and board materials, and administrative coordination including calendar management.

**What I've been doing:** designing and building revenue systems, implementing Salesforce automation (Apex classes, Flows), deploying production integrations (Slack, Outlook, Obsidian), and creating the data infrastructure that powers GTM decision-making. This required skills in systems architecture, software development, AI/ML implementation, and cross-platform integration—well beyond the coordination and communication focus of a Chief of Staff role.

This is not incremental expansion—it's a qualitative shift in the nature of the work:

| Dimension | Chief of Staff (Original) | What I've Been Doing |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Mode | Reactive (respond to requests) | Proactive (identify gaps, build solutions) |
| Output | Documents, meetings, coordination | Production systems, code, automation |
| Autonomy | Execute on direction | Define direction, execute independently |
| Scope | Support one leader | Impact entire GTM organization |
| Skills | Communication, organization | Systems thinking, technical execution, AI/ML |

The work I've delivered maps directly to the Revenue Operations Lead JD that Eudia posted 6 months ago—a role requiring 15+ years of experience. I've absorbed these responsibilities while continuing to ensure operational needs are met.

I do not claim "Greatly Exceeds" because I want to be objective: the full value of this infrastructure will be realized in 2026 as the team adopts these systems and we extract insights from clean data. The foundation is built; the returns are ahead. But the scope expansion and the quality of execution in 2025 is undeniable.

## Question 5: In 2026, where do you believe you can make the biggest impact at Eudia?

In 2026, I believe I can make the biggest impact by **activating the sales intelligence capabilities we built** to drive measurable improvements in pipeline velocity, forecast accuracy, and ultimately revenue growth.

**Sales analytics and visibility** — The clean data foundation is in place. Now I can build real-time pipeline insights, velocity benchmarking, and deal health scoring that enables leadership to make faster, data-driven decisions. This means moving from "what happened" to "what should we do."

**Top-of-funnel intelligence** — Using calendar and meeting data to identify patterns in successful deals versus stalled opportunities. Which meeting sequences correlate with faster close rates? What signals predict deal risk? This intelligence can inform new business approach strategies and help the team focus on the right accounts.

**Delivery-to-outcome tracking** — Connecting sales data to implementation outcomes creates a feedback loop. If we can see which deal characteristics correlate with successful delivery, we can scope and sell more effectively. This closes the gap between Sales and Customer Success.

**Revenue forecasting accuracy** — With BL performance metrics, deal velocity data, and clean pipeline information, I can build forecasting models that improve predictability for leadership and Finance.

The infrastructure is in place. 2026 is about extracting value from it—translating clean data into actionable intelligence that accelerates revenue and positions Eudia to scale GTM operations efficiently.

## Question 6: In 2026, what should you be spending more time doing to maximize your impact and outcomes?

**Strategic influence beyond execution** — Moving from "build the thing" to "shape the roadmap." I should spend more time proactively surfacing insights and recommendations to leadership rather than waiting for requests. The data I now have access to can inform strategic decisions—I need to translate it into actionable recommendations.

**Cross-functional enablement** — Ensuring the tools and systems I build are fully adopted and understood by the teams they serve. Implementation is only half the value—driving adoption and behavior change completes it. I should invest more time in training, documentation, and feedback loops with end users.

**Connecting technical work to business outcomes** — I need to get better at translating infrastructure improvements into revenue or efficiency metrics that resonate at the executive level. "Built a Slack integration" means less than "reduced time BLs spend on data entry by X hours per week." Quantifying impact makes the work visible and defensible.

**Building relationships across the organization** — As my scope has expanded, I'm now building tools that affect Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Finance, and Delivery. Deeper relationships with leaders in each area will help me prioritize effectively and ensure the systems I build solve real problems.

**Developing others** — If these systems are going to scale, I can't be the only person who understands them. I should spend time building knowledge within the team and eventually building out RevOps capabilities beyond just my own contribution.

## Summary

2025 was about building the foundation—solving the structural problem of scattered customer intelligence and manual data entry. I went from coordination to construction, from support to systems architecture.

2026 is about activation—turning that foundation into measurable business value. Pipeline velocity. Forecast accuracy. Revenue growth. The infrastructure is ready. The impact is ahead.
