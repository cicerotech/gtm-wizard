# Eudia Sales Vault -- Getting Started

Hi Nikhita,

Your Eudia Sales Vault is ready! It's a personal account intelligence hub that lives on your desktop -- pre-loaded with all of your CS accounts, key contacts, and meeting tools.

## Setup (takes ~2 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Obsidian (free)

Download from [obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download) and install it. It's a lightweight note-taking app that runs locally on your machine.

### Step 2: Download Your Vault

Go to **[Getting Started](https://gtm-wizard.onrender.com/getting-started)** and click **Download Vault**. This gives you a ZIP file with everything pre-configured.

### Step 3: Open in Obsidian

1. Unzip the downloaded file
2. Open Obsidian
3. Click **Open folder as vault** and select the unzipped folder ("Business Lead Vault 2026")

### Step 4: Enter Your Email

When the vault opens, you'll see a **Setup** tab. Enter your work email (`nikhita.godiwala@eudia.com`) and click Connect. Your 100 account folders will load instantly, and contact/intelligence data will auto-populate from Salesforce in the background.

## What You'll See

- **100 Account Folders** -- Each account has sub-notes for Contacts, Intelligence, Meeting Notes, and Next Steps
- **Key Contacts** -- Auto-populated from Salesforce with names, titles, emails, and phone numbers
- **CS Manager Dashboard** -- Overview of your team's accounts with rep-level breakdowns
- **Meeting Recording** -- Click the mic icon to record meetings; AI generates structured summaries and syncs to Salesforce

## Tips

- The **Setup** tab stays available if you ever need to re-sync
- Account data refreshes from Salesforce each time you connect
- Meeting notes save directly into the relevant account folder
- Everything runs locally on your machine -- your data stays private
