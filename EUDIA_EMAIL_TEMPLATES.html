<h2>1. Cold Outreach Templates</h2>

<!-- Template 1.1: CLO Outcome-Based Intro -->
<div class="template-box">
  <div class="template-header">Template 1.1: CLO Outcome-Based Introduction</div>
  <div class="template-meta">Use Case: Initial outreach to CLO/GC at target account | Best for: Enterprise accounts with 100+ legal team</div>
  
  <div class="email-content">
    <div class="subject-line">Subject: Legal operating model for [COMPANY]'s next phase</div>
    
    <p>Hi <span class="variable">[FIRST NAME]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>I'm reaching out because <span class="variable">[COMPANY]</span> is at an inflection point that we see with ambitious legal teams: <span class="variable">[SPECIFIC TRIGGER - e.g., "recent Series C", "geographic expansion into EMEA", "3 acquisitions in 18 months"]</span>.</p>
    
    <p>The question isn't whether your team explores AI—it's whether you can demonstrate measurable business outcomes in 2026 when budgets tighten and AI "exploration" won't be defensible.</p>
    
    <p>Eudia helps in-house legal teams like yours move from AI ideas to operational impact within days, not quarters. We're not selling tools or productivity dashboards—we're delivering outcomes:</p>
    
    <ul style="margin: 12px 0 12px 24px;">
      <li>Outside counsel cost reduction (30-60% in contract review and compliance)</li>
      <li>Contracting velocity (2-3x faster cycle times)</li>
      <li>Revenue enablement (unblocking deals through faster legal turnaround)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Our approach: embed AI engineers and legal strategists inside your team, deploy our Augmented Intelligence Platform, and drive measurable results while building your Company Brain—an always-learning knowledge layer that reduces dependency on external firms and scales institutional expertise.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Worth 15 minutes?</strong> Happy to share how <span class="variable">[COMPARABLE COMPANY - e.g., "a Fortune 500 manufacturer"]</span> reduced outside counsel spend by $<span class="variable">[AMOUNT]</span> in <span class="variable">[TIMEFRAME]</span> and accelerated M&A due diligence from weeks to days.</p>
    
    <p>Best,<br>

    Eudia</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="use-case">

<div class="template-box">
  <div class="template-header">Template 1.2: VP Legal / Functional Lead (Contracting Focus)</div>
  <div class="template-meta">Use Case: Outreach to VP Legal, Head of Contracting, or Commercial Counsel | Best for: High-volume contracting orgs</div>
  
  <div class="email-content">
    <div class="subject-line">Subject: Contract turnaround at [COMPANY]</div>
    
    <p>Hi <span class="variable">[FIRST NAME]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>I imagine your legal team is managing <span class="variable">[CONTRACT VOLUME ESTIMATE - e.g., "thousands of vendor agreements annually"]</span> while the business asks for faster turnaround without adding headcount or blowing the outside counsel budget.</p>
    
    <p>We work with in-house teams at <span class="variable">[COMPARABLE COMPANIES]</span> to solve exactly this: accelerate contracting without sacrificing quality or control.</p>
    
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> We embed AI engineers alongside your team, deploy our contract intelligence platform, and deliver measurable results within the first 30 days—typically 2-3x faster review cycles and 40-60% reduction in routine outside counsel spend.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike LegalTech point solutions that require your team to learn new software, we build on your existing processes and institutional knowledge. Our platform becomes your Company Brain—learning from every contract, every redline, every negotiation.</p>
    
    <p>Quick example: <span class="variable">[CASE STUDY PREVIEW - e.g., "A B2B SaaS company reduced contract turnaround from 14 days to 3 days and cut outside counsel costs by $180K in 90 days"]</span>.</p>
    
    <p>Worth a conversation to see if there's a fit?</p>

<h2>2. Follow-Up Templates</h2>

<!-- Template 2.1: Post-Initial Meeting -->

    <p>Hi <span class="variable">[FIRST NAME]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for the time today. Three takeaways from our conversation:</p>
    
    <ol style="margin: 12px 0 12px 24px;">
      <li><span class="variable">[KEY PAIN POINT #1 they mentioned]</span></li>
      <li><span class="variable">[KEY PAIN POINT #2]</span></li>
      <li><span class="variable">[TIMING/BUDGET CONSTRAINT]</span></li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Based on what you shared, here's how we'd approach this:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Phase 1 (Days 1-30):</strong> Deploy Sigma to get immediate visibility into <span class="variable">[SPECIFIC WORKFLOW - e.g., "contract review bottlenecks"]</span> and capture the data needed to build your Company Brain. This typically shows <span class="variable">[OUTCOME - e.g., "20-30% time savings"]</span> immediately.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Phase 2 (Days 30-90):</strong> Embed our AI engineers to tackle <span class="variable">[HIGHEST-VALUE PROBLEM - e.g., "M&A due diligence"]</span>. Target outcome: <span class="variable">[SPECIFIC METRIC - e.g., "reduce diligence time from 6 weeks to 10 days"]</span>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Sigma starts at $10K/month. Embedded engineering scales based on scope but typically <span class="variable">[PRICING GUIDANCE - e.g., "$30-50K/month for a focused initiative"]</span>.</p>
    
    <p>Attaching: <span class="variable">[RELEVANT CASE STUDY]</span> that mirrors your <span class="variable">[SPECIFIC CHALLENGE]</span> situation.</p>
    
    <p>Next step: <span class="variable">[SPECIFIC ASK - e.g., "30-min technical deep-dive with your Head of Contracting?"]</span></p>

    <p>Quick context: In-house teams like yours typically spend <span class="variable">[PAIN POINT STAT - e.g., "$500K-$2M annually on M&A diligence"]</span>. We've helped companies reduce that by 40-60% while cutting timelines in half.</p>
    
    <p>Worth 15 minutes to explore if there's a fit?</p>
    
    <p>If timing isn't right, happy to reconnect in <span class="variable">[TIMEFRAME - e.g., "Q1 2026"]</span>.</p>

<h2>5. Objection Handling Templates</h2>

<!-- Template 5.1: "We're Already Using [LegalTech Tool]" -->

    <div class="subject-line">Subject: Eudia + [THEIR TOOL]: complementary, not competitive</div>
    
    <p>Hi <span class="variable">[FIRST NAME]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>Great that you're using <span class="variable">[THEIR TOOL]</span>—we actually see that as complementary, not competitive.</p>
    
    <p>Here's the difference:</p>
    
    <ul style="margin: 12px 0 12px 24px;">
      <li><strong><span class="variable">[THEIR TOOL]</span>:</strong> Software platform your team uses for <span class="variable">[SPECIFIC FUNCTION]</span></li>
      <li><strong>Eudia:</strong> Embedded AI engineers + platform that drives measurable business outcomes and builds your proprietary Company Brain</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Think of it this way: <span class="variable">[THEIR TOOL]</span> is infrastructure. Eudia is the team + intelligence layer that delivers results on top of your existing stack.</p>
    
    <p>Most of our customers use tools like <span class="variable">[THEIR TOOL]</span>, <span class="variable">[OTHER COMMON TOOLS]</span>. We integrate with them to drive outcomes you're not getting from software alone.</p>
    
    <p>Example: <span class="variable">[CUSTOMER]</span> was using <span class="variable">[SAME TOOL]</span> but still spending $<span class="variable">[AMOUNT]</span> annually on outside counsel for routine contracts. We reduced that by 60% in 90 days while making <span class="variable">[THEIR TOOL]</span> more valuable through better training data.</p>

    <p>Hi <span class="variable">[FIRST NAME]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>Understood on budget timing. A few thoughts that might help with planning:</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. ROI Timeline:</strong> Our engagements typically pay for themselves within <span class="variable">[TIMEFRAME - e.g., "90-120 days"]</span> through outside counsel savings alone. For <span class="variable">[COMPARABLE COMPANY]</span>, the math was straightforward: $<span class="variable">[MONTHLY INVESTMENT]</span>/month investment → $<span class="variable">[MONTHLY SAVINGS]</span>/month savings = positive cash flow by Month 3.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Pilot Structure:</strong> We can start with a focused 60-day pilot on <span class="variable">[SPECIFIC HIGH-VALUE PROBLEM]</span> for $<span class="variable">[PILOT AMOUNT]</span>. This gives you proof of concept before larger budget commitment.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Funding Sources:</strong> Several customers fund Eudia from:</p>
    <ul style="margin: 12px 0 12px 24px;">
      <li>Reallocated outside counsel budget (not new spend)</li>
      <li>Innovation/transformation budget (IT or Finance)</li>

    <p>Hi <span class="variable">[FIRST NAME]</span>,</p>
    
    <p>As you finalize 2026 budgets, wanted to resurface the Eudia conversation—particularly around how we help legal teams deliver measurable ROI that justifies AI investment.</p>
    
    <p>2026 reality: CFOs won't approve more "AI exploration" budget without proof. They will approve initiatives that demonstrably reduce costs or unlock revenue.</p>
    
    <p>Eudia's approach makes this easy to justify:</p>
    <ul style="margin: 12px 0 12px 24px;">
      <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Deploy Sigma ($10K/month) for immediate visibility and data capture</li>
      <li><strong>Months 2-3:</strong> Embedded engineers deliver first outcomes (typically 30-60% reduction in target workflow costs)</li>
      <li><strong>Month 4+:</strong> Company Brain scales—outcomes compound without linear cost increase</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For <span class="variable">[COMPARABLE CUSTOMER]</span>, the budget conversation was simple: reallocate $<span class="variable">[AMOUNT]</span> from outside counsel → fund Eudia → net savings of $<span class="variable">[AMOUNT]</span> in Year 1.</p>
