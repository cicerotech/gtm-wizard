# December 2025 ACV Redistribution Plan

**Generated:** December 21, 2025

## Executive Summary

The December expiring revenue of **$1,696,300** needs to be realigned with Johnson Hana data. Based on analysis:

| Category | Count | December Amount | Action |
|----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| No JH Data (US/EUDIA-only) | 5 | $710,238 | No change needed |
| Needs Verification | 7 | $977,362 | Review & redistribute |
| Missing JH Data | 1 | $8,700 | Add missing opps |

**Key Principle:** Total revenue stays the same - this is a *reshuffling* of ACV, not a reduction.

---

## Category 1: No JH Data (No Action Needed)

These accounts have no Johnson Hana data and are likely US pod or EUDIA-originated. December amounts are correctly captured.

| Account | December Expiring | EUDIA Total | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Uisce Eireann | $434,886 | $3,410,671 | ✅ Correct - no JH overlap |
| Cargill | $150,000 | $2,821,000 | ✅ US pod |
| Intuit | $75,000 | $560,000 | ✅ US deal |
| Peregrine Hospitality | $42,000 | $42,000 | ✅ US pod |

## Execution Steps

1. **Export backup** of all December expiring opportunities
2. **Document current totals** before any changes
3. **Update December opportunities** with correct (lower) amounts
4. **Update target opportunities** with redistributed amounts
5. **Verify totals** - should match before/after
6. **Update term fields** where needed to align with JH

---

## Fields to Update per Opportunity

For each opportunity in the redistribution:
- `Revenue` (or `Amount`) - the main value to change
- `JH_Original_ACV__c` - document the JH source value
- `ACV_Variance_Reason__c` - set to "Bundle Allocation" or "Rate Adjustment"
- `Term_Months__c` - correct if different from JH
