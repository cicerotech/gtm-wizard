## 3. Messaging/Positioning Patterns

### Core Value Proposition Statement

> "We work with the world's leading legal teams to deliver measurable business outcomes – faster contracting, reduced outside counsel costs, and unlocked business intelligence"

**Pattern:** Always leads with **customer type** (leading legal teams) + **promise of measurable outcomes** + **specific benefit examples**.

### The "Company Brain" Concept

This is Eudia's central differentiating concept that appears across all decks:

**Definition (from decks):**
> "The Company Brain is not a static database – it's a living intelligence system"

**Components:**
1. **Ingests** knowledge across contracts, litigation files, compliance policies, prior deals, regulatory frameworks
2. **Structures** and operationalizes knowledge to be reusable, searchable, workflow-embedded
3. **Trains** custom "MINDs" for high-value domains (M&A, Compliance, Contracting)
4. **Learns** continuously, compounding enterprise legal intelligence over time

**Key Differentiation:**
> "This means the legal department doesn't start from zero with each matter. Instead, the Company Brain builds cumulative advantage, accelerating outcomes, reducing reliance on professional services firms and law firms"

### Pain Point Language Patterns

| Pain Point Category | Language Used |
|---------------------|---------------|
| **Resource Constraints** | "In-house legal teams are stretched thin on manual, low complexity work that takes away from being a strategic partner to the business" |
| **Knowledge Silos** | "Currently stored in static playbooks, siloed systems and often trapped in the brains of individuals, external law firms, or consulting firms" |
| **Misaligned Incentives** | "Traditional law firms using billable hours have misaligned incentives to adopt AI; SaaS companies sell seats not tied to outcomes" |
| **Strategic Elevation** | "Enterprise legal, procurement, and compliance teams face a once in a generation opportunity to elevate their functions from a cost-center to a strategic enabler" |
| **Access to Justice** | "90% of Americans who need a lawyer can't afford one" / "A single legal event can bankrupt the average American" |

### Value Proposition Framework

Eudia articulates value across three dimensions consistently:

| Dimension | Headline | Descriptor |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Speed** | "Drive Speed" | "Infusing AI into legal workflows to speed up the business" |
| **Cost** | "Reduce Cost" | "Reducing outside counsel spend or optimize team design to unlock cost efficiencies" |
| **Edge** | "Create an AI Edge" | "Leveraging AI to give you a competitive advantage against your counterparties or competitors" |

**Supporting Enablers:**
- **Data:** "Transform your contracts, institutional knowledge, and workflows into a powerful data layer to power AI"
- **Analytics:** "Turn usage into intelligence for building the AI-Augmented legal team of the future"

### Quantified Outcomes (Proof Points)

| Metric | Context | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **30% Faster** | Marketing review times | Intuit case |
| **50% Faster** | Contract turnaround times | Coherent case |
| **50% Cheaper** | M&A diligence costs | General claim |
| **$12M+ value** | From transforming 20K+ contracts | Cargill case |
| **$105M** | Series A funding | Credibility |

**Pattern:** Metrics are always paired with specific use cases, not abstract claims.

### Customer Voice/Testimonials

Direct executive quotes featured prominently:

> "Eudia has transformed the way we deliver contracts by fusing AI with legal expertise. We are closing deals faster and accelerating key business objectives"
> — **Rob Beard, CLO, Coherent**

> "It took Eudia two weeks to deploy a custom solution for us… the team is already seeing a 30% decrease to review marketing content from the business"
> — **Kerry McLean, EVP GC, Intuit**

**Pattern:** Quotes always from **C-level/senior legal leaders** with **title and company**, featuring **specific outcomes**.

## 4. Competitive Positioning

### How Eudia Differentiates

**Against Traditional Law Firms:**
- "Billable hours have misaligned incentives to adopt AI"
- Eudia ties to outcomes, not hours

**Against Legal Tech SaaS:**
- "SaaS companies sell seats not tied to outcomes"
- Eudia delivers full-stack (AI + data + human expertise)

**Unique Position:**
> "Eudia brings the full-stack solution required to deliver real business outcomes for enterprise customers: combining AI technology, knowledge + data, and human expertise to unlock value"

### F500 Enterprise Credibility

Consistent emphasis on:
- "Purpose-Built to Work with F500 Teams"
- "Outcomes We've Delivered for F500 Enterprise"
- "We have a proven track record of driving real business value across the world's leading legal teams"
- "Backed by visionary investors" (with $105M Series A)

---

## 5. Sales Mechanics

### Target Stakeholders

Based on messaging, primary audience is:
1. **CLO (Chief Legal Officer)** - "We work with CLOs to align AI deployment to critical company objectives"
2. **GC (General Counsel)** - Executive quotes from EVP GC
3. **Legal Operations** - Implicit in workflow/efficiency messaging
4. **Procurement/Compliance** - Explicitly mentioned as parallel functions

### Implementation/Deployment Messaging

> "Get started rapidly and optimize as you scale impact across your business"
> "Leveraging AI, data, and expertise to deliver in weeks, not quarters"
> "It took Eudia two weeks to deploy a custom solution"

**Pattern:** Speed of deployment is a key differentiator. Weeks, not months/quarters.

### Pricing Approach

The Pricing Overview deck (2 slides) is minimal in this sample, but framework suggests:
- Tiered structure based on contract types
- Flexibility: "Final assignment on contact types will be confirmed within the SOW; Contracts types can flex tiers"
- SOW-based (Statement of Work) engagement model
